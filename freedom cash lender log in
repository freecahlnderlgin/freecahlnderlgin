A cash flow loan is a type of unsecured borrowing that is used for day-to-day operations of a small business. The loan is used to finance working capital—payments for inventory, payroll, rent, etc.—and is paid back with incoming cash flows of the business.

Cash flow loans are not considered conventional bank loans, which entail a more thorough credit analysis of a business. Instead, a lender makes an assessment of the cash flow generation capacity of the borrower when determining the terms of a cash flow loan.
