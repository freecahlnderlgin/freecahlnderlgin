This is the first such partnership that Fidelity has inked with a crypto-lending service. "For Fidelity Digital Assets, this is an exciting first step into supporting the thriving lending market for digital assets and deepens our relationships within the digital assets ecosystem with leading firms like BlockFi which allows us to provide even more institutional-grade solutions to investors in this space," stated Christine Sandler, head of sales and marketing at Fidelity Digital Assets.

Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital Assets, told Bloomberg that adding Bitcoin as collateral for loans was a "foundational capability" and that the firm expected this feature to become a "fairly important part of the (crypto) ecosystem."
